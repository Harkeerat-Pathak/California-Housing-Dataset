# California-Housing-Dataset


#### Here is the California housing data set, which contains data drawn from the 1990 U.S. Census. The following table provides descriptions, data ranges, and data types for each feature in the data set. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). A household is a group of people residing within a home. Since the average number of rooms and bedrooms in this dataset are provided per household, these columns may take surprisingly large values for block groups with few households and many empty houses, such as vacation resorts. It can be downloaded/loaded using the :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing` function.
